1.Current System Design

Django REST API backend

SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)

SyncEvent model storing:

device_id, timestamp, total_files_synced, total_errors, internet_speed

2.Scaling for 5000+ devices/hour

Database optimizations

Switch to PostgreSQL

Add indexes → device_id, timestamp

Use partitioning (by month or device group) when table grows large

Batch event ingestion

Support API to receive multiple sync events in one request

Use Django bulk_create() to insert events efficiently

Asynchronous processing

Add a message queue → RabbitMQ or Redis

Offload sync event handling to background workers (Celery)

Caching

Cache results for expensive queries (like repeated-failures) using Redis

Horizontal scaling

Run multiple Django app servers behind a load balancer (Nginx + Gunicorn)

Make sure the app is stateless (no local sessions)

Monitoring + autoscaling

Add Prometheus + Grafana or Datadog

Track API latency, DB performance, worker queue length

Enable autoscaling on cloud (AWS/GCP)

3.Database

Use sharded PostgreSQL or a distributed DB (like CockroachDB or YugabyteDB)

Store older data in a data lake (S3, BigQuery) + keep recent events in the main DB

Event streaming

Replace API → queue → DB pattern with event streaming (Apache Kafka)

Process millions of events with scalable consumers

Advanced caching

Use Redis or Memcached to store:

Recent device status

Frequent queries (top devices, failure rates)

Autoscaling workers

Dynamically scale Celery workers based on queue backlog

API rate limiting

Add throttling per device to protect the system

Observability

Add distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)

Alert on error rates, throughput, and anomalies
